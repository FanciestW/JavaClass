 Rectangle rect = new Rectangle (0, 2, 4, 4);

 System.out.println (dist);
} 

This outputs:
5.0

This is the output because:
Lets look at all the methods. the distance method takes two Points as parameters named p1 and p2. And returns a double. It creates two integer variables named dx and dy. dx is equal to p1.x - p2.x and dy is equal to p1.y - p2.y It then returns the square root of (dx*dx + dy*dy) which is just dx squared plus dy squared. And returning the square root is always a double. This method basically returns the distance between the two Points that were the parameters. The next method named findCenter takes a Rectangle as a parameter named box and returns a Point. The findCenter method creates two integer variables named x and y. x is equal to box.x + box.width/2 and y is equal to box.y + box.height/2. It then returns a new Point with the x as the new Points x value and y as the new Points y value. Basically this method finds the center points of the Rectangle that was passed in as a parameter. Now we get to the main method. In the main method a new Point named blank is create with the x-value = 5 and y-value = 8. Then a new Rectangle is created named rect and its x value is 0 and its y value is 2. It's width and height are both 4 so it's techncally a square. Then a new Point is created named center to equal the return value of the method findCenter with the parameter rect passed to it. This finds the center of the rectangle and returns that center points which is (2,4). So now Point center is equal to (2,4). Afterwards a double variable is created named dist and it is equal to the return value of the method distance with the Point center and Point blank passed on as parameters. So this method finds the distance between the points (2,4) and (5,8) which is 5. But 5.0 is printed because dist is a double since the return value of the distance method is a double. A double that is a whole number is printed as itself followed by a decimal and a zero. So the output is 5.0

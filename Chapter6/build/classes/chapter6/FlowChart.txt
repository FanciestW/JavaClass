Method 1:
1. Start
2. Get/Read N
3. Create M and N and set both equal to 1
4. Set F equal to F multiplied by M
5. Check if M is equal to N.
	-If no, make M = M + 1 and go back to step 4 and repeat from there.
	-If yes, continure to step 6.
6. Output/Write the value of F.
7. End

Method 2:
Start
Input N
Create M, Set M = 1
Create F, Set F = 1
Set F = F * M
While M is not equal to N
	Set M = M + 1
	F = F * M
Output F
End

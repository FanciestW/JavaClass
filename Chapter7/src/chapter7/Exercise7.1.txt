public class Mystery {
 	public static String bing (String s) {
		int i = s.length() - 1;

The output is:

Why?:
Lets look at the only method other than the main method. The method bing takes a single parameter as a String s and returns a String value. So it initializes a variable named i as an integer. And sets the value of i to the length of the String s minus 1. Another variable names total is initialized as a String and set to "". Which is a blank string. Then a while loop is started with the conditions being i >= 0. Which means as long as i is greater than or equal to 0 keep looping the while loop. So in the while loop it creates a char variable and set it to the char at the i index of s. It then prints the the value of i + a space and the ch which is the character at i index of s.  It addes the ch character to the string total and decrementates i by 1. So i = i - 1. After the while loop stops looping it returns the value of total. Now lets look at the main method. Where there is only one statement. It prints the return value of bing when "Allen" is passed as a parameter. So length of "Allen" is 5 but the method bing minus 1 from that length and sets it to i. It string a blank string as total. Then it goes to the while loop.  i is 4 so the loop starts. the char at s index of 4, which is what i is for now, is 'n' It prints "4 n" and adds 'n' to the String total and minus 1 from i. Making i 3.The loops goes again and gets ch is 'e' so it prints "3 e" It adds 'e' to the String total so now the String total contains the string "ne". It minus 1 from i again leaving i with 2. It loops again and ch is now l and it prints "2 l". Adds 'l' to total leaving the String total to be "nel". It minues 1 from i leaving it to be 1. It loops again and gets ch = 'l' it prints "1 l". Adding 'l' to total leaving the value of total equal to "nell". It minuses 1 from i again and now i is 0. it runs again and ch is = 'A' Printing "0 A". And adding 'A' to total. Now total has a value of "nellA" It minuses 1 from i which makes it -1 and now the loop does the run again because the conditions are not met. So it goes to return the value of total which is "nellA" and when it is returned it is what is printed in main. So the output is:
4 n
3 e
2 l
1 l
0 A

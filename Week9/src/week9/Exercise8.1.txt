public static void main (String[] args)
{
 int x = 5;
 Point blank = new Point (1, 2);
 System.out.println (fred (x, blank));
 System.out.println (x);
 System.out.println (blank.x);
 System.out.println (blank.y);
}
public static int fred (int x, Point p)
{
 x = x + 7;
 return x + p.x + p.y;
}

The output of the code above is:
15
5
1
2

This is the output because:
Let's look at the fred method. It takes an integer and a Point as a parameter. The integer is x and the Point is p. In the method it sets the integer x equal to x + 7.Then it returns x + p's x value + p's y value. So back to main method. It creates an integer named x and equals it to 5. Then it creates a new Point object named blank and sets it equal to the values (1, 2). Making blank.x = 1 and blank.y = 2. So the main method then prints 4 lines of out put. The line prints the return value of fred with the parameters x and blank passed to it. So x is 5 and blank is (1,2). So in fred it sets x = x + 7 which is 5 + 7 . Which is equal to 12. Then it returns the new value of x plus the x and y value of the Point parameter. So 12 + 1 + 2. Which is 15. So the main method prints 15 then starts a new line. Then it prints the value of x which is 5 and then it starts a new line. Then it prints the x value of the Point blank which is 1, then it starts a new line. Then it prints the y value of Point blank which is 2 and then it starts a new line. Then the program ends.
